**Summary: Machine Learning Methods for Lung Cancer Level Classification**

This research thoroughly examines the application of machine learning (ML) models in accurately classifying lung cancer stages.

**Methodology:**

- A comprehensive dataset of lung cancer patient data was collected from various sources.
- Nine ML models were employed: XGBoost, LGBM, Adaboost, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, CatBoost, k-NN, and DNN.
- Hyperparameter optimization was performed to minimize overfitting and improve model performance, focusing on minimum child weight and learning rate.

**Key Findings:**

- XGBoost, LGBM, and Logistic Regression outperformed other models, achieving accuracies of nearly 100%.
- Adaboost exhibited sensitivity to learning rate adjustments.
- Random Forest, CatBoost, and k-NN also demonstrated high accuracy and stability.
- DNN, despite its ability to detect complex patterns, was outperformed by traditional ML models.

**Conclusions:**

- Careful consideration of hyperparameters is crucial to optimize ML model performance for lung cancer classification.
- Conventional ML models like XGBoost, LGBM, and Logistic Regression offer superior accuracy and generalization capabilities.
- These models can effectively support clinicians in lung cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.
- Further research should focus on exploring larger datasets and advanced ML techniques to enhance predictive accuracy and clinical utility.
